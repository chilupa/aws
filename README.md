### Analytics:
- **Amazon Athena**
    - interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL
    - serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run
    - Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema versioning.
- **Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES)**
    - Amazon OpenSearch Service makes it easy for you to perform interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, website search, and more
